I created this app to notify those picking me up
from the train station as to when I would be arriving.

It is not complete yet.

The app is meant to incorporate twilio in order to send messages
out to certain individuals when I need to be picked up from the train
station. The front-end design is non-existent so far as I'm stuck on
the back-end incorporation of the twilio.

The front end design is meant to have options for which trains are
available in accordance with the train schedule, and options for which
individuals can pick me up. Once boarding the train, I would click on the
train that I boarded and individual to pick me up.

At which point that person would be sent a message notifying them of what time
I will arrive.

Realistically, I just wanted a button to push that used a current time function
so it could just tell my parents to pick me up (as I always forget to text them
until after I get off the train).

Ideally, I wanted GPS tracking to automatically handle it for me based on the time
as opposed to needing to push that button.

I have some twilio incorporated in, but not fully and I am missing the simple front end piece.
